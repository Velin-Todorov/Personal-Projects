This is my first serious project. 
I followed this tutorial on how to build a Tic Tac Toe game with AI. Please refer to this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk9hlNZc6sE

The purpose of following this tutorial is for me to learn how to use pygame and how to code an AI using the MiniMax algorithm.

More will follow on this project:
  1. I am planning to add a Main Menu screen which contains general information about this project.
  2. A pop-up/message, which displays who the winner is and what to do if the player wants to play again.
